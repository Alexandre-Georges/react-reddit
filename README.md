# Reddit client with ReactJS

This page gets from Reddit the ReactJS thread and displays its posts. Posts can be clicked to display, or hide, their comments.

Comments can be sorted is there are at least 2 of them.

## Disclaimer

This is my first good-sized project with React, I am sure some parts can be optimized or more elegant but it was really fun to learn.

## Usage

No server is needed, Reddit's API is very permissive. The index can simply get opened in a browser.

## Frameworks

This project uses mainly React to generate the UI, Jquery is also included to call Reddit's API and Bootstrap is there to make the design easier.
